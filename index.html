                Mathematics is one of, if not, the most fundamental tool that we have to understand the world around us.  Through the understanding of mathematics and it's properties we are able to build, create, plan, analyze, predict and so much more.

            </h1>
            <p>
                Physics is perhaps the second most important tool in understanding the world around us only behind Mathematics.  This is because physics takes the real world observations and links those observations to mathematical structures which allow us to better understand reality.

                Engineering quite literally builds off of Mathematics and Physics in order to create nuanced structure to improve our everyday lives.  From buildings to machinery to the very keyboard that I am using to type this, Engineering was there every step of the way.

                Technology is perhaps the pinnacle of all of these sciences and is currently at it's most prevalent in society.  We live in the digital age, from bank accounts to school websites, connecting with friends from across the globe and so much more.
